Picture Renamer Application
Overview

The Picture Renamer application allows users to upload photos corresponding to a list of custom photo names. Users can enter a list of names, upload multiple photos for each name, and download the renamed photos in a ZIP file. The app is designed to be flexible, allowing users to skip uploading photos for certain names while still generating the ZIP file with a warning about any missing files.
Features

    Custom Photo Names Input: Users can input a list of photo names, one per line.
    Multiple Photo Uploads: For each photo name, users can upload multiple photos and dynamically add additional file inputs.
    Image Previews: Uploaded photos are displayed as thumbnails for easy preview.
    ZIP File Generation: All uploaded photos are renamed according to the provided names and compressed into a downloadable ZIP file.
    Missing File Warning: Users are warned about any missing photos (i.e., names without uploaded files) but can still generate the ZIP file with the available photos.

    How to Use

    Enter Photo Names:
        On the main screen, enter a list of photo names, one per line.
        Click Next to generate the file upload form.

    Upload Photos:
        For each photo name, upload one or more photos.
        To add more photos for a specific name, click the Add Photo button.

    Process Files:
        Once you've uploaded your photos, click the Process button.
        If some photo names are missing uploaded files, you will receive a warning, but the ZIP file will still be generated with the available photos.

    Download the ZIP File:
        The app will generate a ZIP file containing the renamed photos, which you can download.

Example Workflow

    Enter the following names into the text box:

Photo_A
Photo_B
Photo_C

Upload files for "Photo_A" and "Photo_B", but leave "Photo_C" without an uploaded file.
Click Process.
A warning will appear indicating that no file was uploaded for "Photo_C".
A ZIP file will be generated containing the uploaded files, renamed as Photo_A.jpg, Photo_B.jpg, etc.
